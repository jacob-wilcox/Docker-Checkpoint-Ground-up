Your full-stack app should display a &lt;div> whose contents are the result of an API call from the React app to the Express server, and the Express server to the database via Knex, which will render in the browser a message of your choosing. Something friendly like "Welcome to your Dockerized Express/React full-stack app!" will be great.
